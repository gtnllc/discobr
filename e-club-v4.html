          <h3>Discover Branson Privacy Policy</h3><p>Our privacy policy tells you what personal data (PD) and non-personal data (NPD) Discover Branson may collect from you, how we collect it, how we protect it, how we may share it, and how you can access, change, or delete it. Our privacy policy also explains certain legal rights that you have with respect to your personal data. If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, please write to us by email at webmaster@DiscoverBranson.com or by mail to Discover Branson, 1105 W. 76 Country Blvd. Branson, MO 65616, Attn: Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all websites, domains, sub domains, software, offerings, information portals, and registries (“site”, “sites” and/or “services”) maintained by Discover Branson.</p><h5>DEFINITIONS</h5><ul><li>‘Non-personal data’ (NPD) is information that is in no way personally identifiable.</li><li>‘Personal data’ (PD) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Personal Data is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, Personal Data is broader in scope and covers more data.</li><li>A “visitor” is someone who merely browses our website. A “user” is someone who has registered with us to use or buy our services and products.</li></ul><h5>Information We Collect</h5><p>Generally, you control the amount and type of information that you provide to us when using our website.</p><h5>OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA (EEA Individuals Only)</h5><p>If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for processing your personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p><p>However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to process personal data about you to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p><p>If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our website and communicate with you as necessary to provide our products and services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest. These legitimate interests include, for example, responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p><p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided above.</p><h4>We Collect Your Personal Data in the Following Ways</h4><h5>AUTOMATIC INFORMATION</h5><p>We automatically receive information from your web browser or mobile device.

The new business would retain the right to use your Personal Data according to the terms of this privacy policy as well as to any changes to this privacy policy as instituted by the new business.</p><p>We also retain the right to transfer your Personal Data if our company files for bankruptcy and some or all of our assets are sold to another individual or business.</p><h5>Retaining Your Personal Data</h5><p>We retain Personal Data that you provide us as long as we consider it potentially useful in contacting you about our product or our other services, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements, and then we securely delete the data.

We will not sell, rent, or trade your email address to any unaffiliated third party without your permission except in the sale or transfer of our business, or if our company files for bankruptcy.</p><h5>OUR SECURITY POLICY</h5><p>We have built our website and products using industry-standard security measures and authentication tools to protect the security of your Personal Data. We and the third parties who provide services for us, also maintain technical and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Data. We also periodically monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, consistent with industry standards. When we collect your credit card information through our website, we will encrypt it before it travels over the Internet using industry-standard technology for conducting secure online transactions. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee against the loss or misuse of your Personal Data or secure data transmission over the Internet because of its nature.</p><p>We strongly urge you to protect any password you may have for our website and to not share it with anyone. You should always log out of our website when you finish using it, especially if you are sharing or using a computer in a public place.

We use third-party billing services. We use our commercially reasonable efforts to make sure your credit card number is kept strictly confidential by using only third-party billing services that use industry-standard encryption technology to protect your credit card number from unauthorized use. However, you understand and agree that we are in no way responsible for any misuse of your credit card number.</p><h5>DATA TRANSFERS AND PRIVACY SHIELD</h5><p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).</p><p>We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this privacy notice.</p><p>Discover Branson has applied to participate in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union (EU) and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Discover Branson has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles, and commits to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles as they apply to the personal data of EU and Swiss residents. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.</p><p>Discover Branson is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Discover Branson complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p><p>Discover Branson commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles. Individuals in the EU or Switzerland may submit queries related to the processing of personal data under the Privacy Shield framework by contacting us directly at webmaster@Discover Branson.com, or by mail to Discover Branson, 1105 W 76 Country Blvd. Branson, MO 65616, Attn: Privacy Policy.</p><p>Discover Branson has further committed to cooperate with the European data protection authorities (the “DPAs”) and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), as applicable. If we have not been able to successfully resolve your query or complaint and you are based in the EEA or Switzerland, you may raise your query or complaint directly to the DPA or Commissioner. The services of the DPAs and Commissioner are provided at no cost to you. You can find details of the relevant DPA at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm. Discover Branson will comply with any advice given by the DPAs and/or Commissioner, and take necessary actions to remediate any non-compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.</p><p>If your inquiry still has not been satisfactorily resolved, you may have other recourse mechanisms such as invoking binding arbitration by the Privacy Shield Panel.</p><h5>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h5><p>We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. If our company decides to change this privacy policy, we will post those changes on our website so that our visitors, users and customers are always aware of what information we collect, use, and disclose. If at any time we decide to disclose or use your Personal Data in a method different from that specified at the time it was collected, we will provide advance notice by email (sent to the email address on file in your account). Otherwise we will use and disclose our users’ and customers’ Personal Data in agreement with the privacy policy in effect when the information was collected. In all cases, your continued use of our website, services, and products after any change to this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p><h5>QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h5><p>If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact us using the information at the top of this privacy policy.</p>
